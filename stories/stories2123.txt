Am I the jerk for yelling at my spoiled sister for braking into my house? 

Am I the jerk for yelling at my spoiled little sister after her breaking in to my brand new house and trying to take my baby? P.s. subscribe to am I the jerk on YouTube!

so this is how it started,

my sister always got her way. I got in trouble for breaking the window in my room even though it was her. That’s the least of my worries. Now she Is breaking in I don’t know how.

One morning, I was getting ready as my phone was blowing up. It was my sister. She was asking for money to pay her bill, I was low myself on money because I had just bought my house and had a successful baby. She wanted a lot, and i said that I was sorry but I couldn’t. She started cussing and saying words I can’t repeat on this show. TWo days later I heard pounding on my door after just putting my baby to bed. It was my sister! I couldn’t believe it. I just ignored her. That night she was Crawling into my window. I kicked her out and wouldn’t you know it? 15 minutes later she was screaming in my Baby room! She was trying to take her away and said ” if you don’t give my the (random number) dollars I will take the baby!” I called the cops and screamed. She got jail time and now my mom is really mad what do I do?
