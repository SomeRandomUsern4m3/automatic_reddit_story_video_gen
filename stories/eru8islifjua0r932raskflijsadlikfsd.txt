AITA for refusing to let my sister and her friends stay over at my house because they were rude to me? 

context: m28 lives alone in an apartment with 3 bedrooms. Last year I let my f22 sister and her friends stay over as they needed accommodation for a night as they are attending a concert in my city.

They didn't mess anything up in my apartment.

However my apartment walls are thin I can hear everything in the room they are staying in especially their gossips and my sister's friends had horrible things to say about me like "you're brother is so ugly, cant believe you got all the good genes" or "he looks autistic and a socially awkward inccel" (Because I'm lanky and wear glasses - still working on it ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚). Also making fun of my OCD and tics.

My sister barely defended me saying "shhh he's giving us a free stay".

But yeah sticks and stones but considering I'm giving them a place free to stay for a night it kinda rubs me the wrong way. But I didn't kick them out and let them stay the whole night.

Additionally I picked all of them up from the airport and dropped them off and none of them were even appreciative for me driving them or letting them stay over. Not even a thank you, like even a 'thank you' would make me turn a blind eye to the gossiping.

Now this year the similar concert is happening, but I refused to let them stay over. And this bugged my sister off a lot with her calling me a petty inccel over small issues.

Am i the petty asshole in this?
