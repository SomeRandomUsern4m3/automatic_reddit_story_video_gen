# What is this?

## This a project that I whipped up in a day it generates those ai reddit stories with the text to speech
### Why? I saw my cousin watching some of these videos and they seemed to be 100% engaged with the video


# You will need FFMPEG and its library
FFMPEG: https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows

Python library:
```pip install ffmpeg-python```



# What to do?

## There is two folders one is game_footage and the other one is stories

### In the game_footage folder copy and paste clips of satisfying game footage, I recommend 20 minute long minecraft parkour videos. As there are multiple sections for the program to cut out of it.

### If it errors then your footage videos obvisouly aren't long enough

## The stories folder works as so

### You put in text files, and the first line of the text file will be recognized as the title. Then enter a new line and paste the story underneath (there are some example in there already)
